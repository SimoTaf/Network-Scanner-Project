# Network-Scanner-Project
This project allows you to create a simple network scanner that is accessible from a web browser on the network.

Essentially with this project we use a Cron Job every 10 minutes to trigger nmap to scan out network and output the results into a text file. We then use a php file to format the text file, add a few things, and present the results for a web browser.
